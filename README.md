# Attendance logger

I'd like to support a children education club in my home town. This club cares about children with physical and mental disabilities. It hit me emotionally to see parents who lost any hope. But after some visits on this club and they see their children begin to pay attention to words, to respond and go by foot. I talked to the owner and we agreed that a attendance logger could increase effiency of the club.
